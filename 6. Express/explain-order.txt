weather-agent

Key Features and Enhancements:
index.html Form Handling:

The root route (GET /) serves an HTML file (index.html) that allows users to input a city name.
When the form is submitted, a POST request is sent to the server with the city name.
API Integration with OpenWeatherMap:

The POST / route makes a real-time API request to OpenWeatherMap using the provided city name.
Parses the JSON response to extract useful information like temperature, weather description, and an icon.
Dynamic HTML Response:

The server dynamically constructs and sends an HTML response based on the weather data.
Displays the temperature, weather description, and an image (icon) representing the current weather.
Logging for Debugging:

Logs various stages of the process (e.g., raw API response, parsed data) to help troubleshoot issues.
Testing with curl:
Serve the HTML Form (GET /):


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Ensures the server is running and serves the index.html form.
Submit a City Name (POST /):


curl -X POST -d "city=London" http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Tests the API integration with OpenWeatherMap.
Ensures the server can parse form data and dynamically respond with weather information.
Submit an Invalid City Name (POST /):



curl -X POST -d "city=InvalidCityName" http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Tests the server's behavior when the API returns an error (e.g., city not found).
Expected behavior: API error is logged, and the client may receive an unhandled error or default response.
Check Response Headers:


curl -I http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Verifies the response headers sent by the server (e.g., Content-Type: text/html).
Notes:

Ensure index.html Exists:

The form in index.html should have an input field named city and a submit button:

<form action="/" method="post">
  <label for="city">Enter a city:</label>
  <input type="text" id="city" name="city" required>
  <button type="submit">Get Weather</button>
</form>
Error Handling:

Add error handling for cases where the API request fails or the city is invalid to improve robustness.

https.get(apiUrl, function (response) {
    if (response.statusCode !== 200) {
        res.send("City not found or API error occurred.");
        return;
    }
});
Security:

Avoid hardcoding API keys in your code. Use environment variables instead. For example:

const apiKey = process.env.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY;


Key Features and Functionality:
Form Submission Workflow:

Users enter a city name in the form field (<input>).
When the "Get Weather" button is clicked, the form data is sent via a POST request to the root URL (/) specified in the action attribute.
Accessibility Enhancements:

The <label> element with the for="city" attribute improves accessibility by linking the label to the input field, ensuring compatibility with screen readers.
Responsive Design:

The <meta name="viewport"> ensures the page is mobile-friendly by scaling content appropriately for smaller screens.
External Resources:

Links to styles.css for custom styling of the application.
Links to app.js for client-side interactivity (e.g., enhancing the form submission process or dynamically displaying weather data).
Dynamic Content Area:

The <div id="weather-info"> is a placeholder for displaying weather details using JavaScript if needed.
Alternate/Improved Comments for Commented-Out Lines:
Commented Form Tag:


<!-- This is an alternate way of defining the form without `enctype`. -->
<!-- <form method="post" action="/" id="weather-form"> -->
<!-- `enctype` is omitted here because `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is the default encoding for text input fields. -->
Commented Input Field:


<!-- This input field includes an `id="city"` attribute, which can be useful for direct DOM manipulation or styling. -->
<!-- <input type="text" id="city" required> -->
Notes:
File Dependencies:
Ensure styles.css, app.js, and index.html are in the same directory.
styles.css is optional but recommended for better visual design.
Additional Enhancements:

Add error messages or client-side validation using JavaScript for a better user experience.
Style the <form>, <input>, and <button> using styles.css for a polished appearance.
