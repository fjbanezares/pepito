solution 3
This code creates a simple Express web server that:

Logs each incoming request's method and URL using a custom middleware (logger).
Defines a single route (/) that responds with "Hello" for HTTP GET requests.
Runs on port 3000 and listens for requests.
curl Commands to Test and Explain:
Basic GET request to /:


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
The middleware logs the HTTP method (GET) and the URL (/) in the console.
The server responds with Hello.
Unmatched URL to test middleware only:


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/unknown
What it proves:
The middleware still logs the request details (method: GET, URL: /unknown), even though the route /unknown does not exist.
You will see a default "Cannot GET /unknown" response from Express.
Simulate a POST request to /:


curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
The middleware logs the HTTP method (POST) and the URL (/).
Since there’s no route defined for POST /, the response will indicate that the route is not found.
Simulate requests with additional headers:


curl -X GET -H "Custom-Header: Testing123" http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
You can add custom headers to the request. Although the server doesn't explicitly handle them, the logger middleware still logs the method and URL.
Test server's response time (using curl flag):


curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Response timing is displayed, demonstrating the server’s performance for simple requests. (Requires a curl-format.txt file for detailed timing output).
By running these commands, you demonstrate how middleware is triggered for every request, regardless of the route, and how the server handles valid and invalid routes. The middleware provides detailed logging for debugging purposes.

Key Features of the Updated Code:
Logging Enhanced with res.on:

The res.on('finish') listener ensures the middleware logs the response's status code after it has been fully sent.
This is lightweight and does not interfere with the response process.
Alternative Logging Using res.send:

The commented-out logger function shows how you can intercept and log response data by overriding the res.send method.
This approach provides more flexibility if you need to inspect or modify response content.
Global Middleware Application:

The middleware is applied globally using app.use(logger), so all routes (current and future) automatically benefit from logging.
curl Commands and What They Prove:
Basic GET Request to /:


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Logs the method (GET) and the URL (/) in the middleware.
Logs the status code (200) when the response finishes.
Sends "Hello" as the response body.
Request to an Undefined Route (/unknown):


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/unknown
What it proves:
Middleware logs the method (GET) and the URL (/unknown).
Logs the response status code (404) when Express's default error handling kicks in.
Returns a default "Cannot GET /unknown" error.
POST Request to /:


curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Middleware logs the method (POST) and the URL (/).
Logs the response status code (404), as no POST handler is defined for /.
Simulating a Response Delay (Test Middleware Logging Timing):


// Add a new delayed route to the code for testing:
app.get("/delay", (req, res) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    res.send("Delayed Response");
  }, 5000); // Delays the response by 5 seconds.
});


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/delay
What it proves:
Middleware logs the request details immediately upon receiving the request.
Logs the response status code (200) only after the response is sent (after the 5-second delay).
Send Custom Headers to Observe Logging:


curl -X GET -H "Test-Header: LoggerTest" http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Although the middleware doesn't handle headers explicitly, the request is logged as usual.
Demonstrates that headers do not interfere with middleware logging.
Benchmark Logging with Multiple Concurrent Requests:


seq 1 10 | xargs -n1 -P5 curl -s http://localhost:3000/ > /dev/null
What it proves:
Logs multiple simultaneous requests and shows how the middleware handles concurrency.
You can observe logs for each request in the console, proving the middleware's robustness.

Summary of Enhancements:
The code now provides more detailed insights into the HTTP response lifecycle using res.on('finish').
An alternative middleware implementation (commented) demonstrates advanced logging capabilities using res.send.
The provided curl commands showcase practical uses, testing middleware behavior, response timing, and robustness under different scenarios.

Middleware for Band Name Generation:

The middleware now generates the band name within the context of the request (req.bandName).
This avoids using a global variable, which is not thread-safe for concurrent users.
File Serving:

The root route (/) serves an HTML file. Make sure the file exists at /public/index.html and has form fields named street and pet.
Dynamic HTML Response:

The POST route (/submit) dynamically displays the generated band name in the response.
Testing with curl:
Access the Root Route (GET /):


curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
What it proves:
Ensures the server is running and serving the HTML file correctly.
You won’t see the HTML rendered in the terminal, but you can confirm the response contains the file content.
Submit Form Data (POST /submit):


curl -X POST -d "street=Sunset&pet=Whiskers" http://localhost:3000/submit
What it proves:
Middleware processes the request body and generates a band name (SunsetWhiskers).
The response contains the generated band name in HTML format.
Submit Missing Data:


curl -X POST -d "street=&pet=" http://localhost:3000/submit
What it proves:
Tests how the middleware handles empty or missing form fields.
The generated band name will likely be an empty string ("").
Submit Special Characters:


curl -X POST -d "street=R$%25oad&pet=C@t" http://localhost:3000/submit
What it proves:
Tests if the server handles special characters in form fields correctly.
The response should display R$%25oadC@t as the band name.
Test with Concurrent Users:

Simulate multiple users by sending simultaneous requests with different data:

curl -X POST -d "street=Broadway&pet=Fluffy" http://localhost:3000/submit &
curl -X POST -d "street=Elm&pet=Max" http://localhost:3000/submit &
What it proves:
Confirms that using req.bandName instead of a global variable ensures the band name is unique per request.

Notes:
Ensure the /public/index.html file contains a form with input fields named street and pet.
Consider applying the bandNameGenerator middleware only to the /submit route instead of globally:


app.post("/submit", bandNameGenerator, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`<h1>Your band name is:</h1><h2>${req.bandName}✌️</h2>`);
});
This approach is more efficient and avoids unnecessary middleware execution for other routes.
