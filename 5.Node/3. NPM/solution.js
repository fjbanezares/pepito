// The line below is commented out because it uses the older CommonJS syntax to import the 'sillyname' module.
// This style is often seen in older Node.js projects before ES6 modules became standard.
//var generateName = require("sillyname");

// This line uses the newer ES6 syntax to import the 'sillyname' module. 
// ES6 module syntax is becoming more standard in modern projects and is characterized by the 'import' keyword.
import generateName from "sillyname";

// Here, the 'generateName' function is called, and its return value (a silly name) is stored in the 'sillyName' variable.
var sillyName = generateName();

// This line prints out a message to the console using the generated silly name.
console.log(`My name is ${sillyName}.`);

// The line below is commented out because, like the earlier example, it uses the older CommonJS syntax to import the 'superheroes' module.
// Again, this style is prevalent in older Node.js projects.
//const superheroes = require("superheroes");

// This line imports the 'superheroes' module using the ES6 syntax.
import superheroes from "superheroes";

// Here, a random superhero name is generated using the 'random' function from the 'superheroes' module 
// and stored in the 'name' variable.
const name = superheroes.random();

// This line prints out a message to the console using the generated superhero name.
console.log(`I am ${name}!`);
